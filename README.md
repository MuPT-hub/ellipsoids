Installing flowermd
===================

Installing `flowermd` from the `conda-forge` channel can be achieved by adding `conda-forge` to your channels with:

```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --set channel_priority strict
```

Once the `conda-forge` channel has been enabled, `flowermd` can be installed with `conda`:

```
conda install flowermd
```

or with `mamba`:

```
mamba install flowermd
```
